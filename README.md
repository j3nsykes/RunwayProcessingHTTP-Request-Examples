# RunwayProcessingHTTP-Request-Examples
StyleGAN model examples communicating via HTTP request between Processing 4.01A and RunwayML
The RunwayML Processing library has permission issues with Processing 4.01A (not 3.5.4) and as such a different HTTP library is used in these templates. 
The examples use the [HTTP-Request-for-Processing Library](https://github.com/runemadsen/HTTP-Requests-for-Processing)

Thanks to Catherine Weir for the HTTP Post Request Runway template and java.util.Base64 methods these examples were built from. 
The methods used in these examples will work for all other models once the JSON data structure matches the model input and output messages.
